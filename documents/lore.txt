Factions
There are 3 primary factions, but many clans that may or may not have allegience to those factions.  The main 3 factions are The Dynasties, Void Nomads, and the Cognita.

The Dynasties
Every family house within this faction wields power both through lineage and the territories they've historically claimed and staunchly defended.

The vastness of space is under the control of five paramount family houses that make up the The Dynasties: Orland, Dravira, Helst, Vyrex, and Calthor. Alliances, honed over decades, can crumble and reforge, with blood feuds echoing across generations. As each house vies for unrivaled dominance, the echoes of their forebears' pride and betrayals reverberate. Orbiting the imposing gas giants, clans have established grand platforms, mining precious gases as potent energy sources. Dynasties, akin to the Jovian Lords and Saturnine Sovereigns, in their quest to broaden their celestial domain, often find territorial disagreements escalating to intense space skirmishes.

Ancestral Oath Rituals: Rooted in time-honored traditions, the unity and competition among the five houses of The Dynasties originate from ancient rituals. Founding ancestors pledged solemn oaths beneath the luminance of their designated gas giants. Modernly, these rites symbolize a passage of lineage, paving the way for emerging alliances and prospective treacheries.

Galactic Feasts: A grandiose banquet is convened every decade, assembling all of The Dynasties. Although conflict is forbidden, the atmosphere is thick with political schemes, clandestine pacts, and covert betrayals.

Quantum Disputes: Dimensional technology allows clans to harvest resources from alternate dimensions, leading to a convoluted web of political alliances and betrayals. The primary 5 clans of The Dynasties are attempting to use the technology to their advantage, but keeping it to themselves proves difficult.

Void Nomads
Often termed the "Starless", this moniker encapsulates the melancholy of their vanished homelands, forsaken identities, and the radiant guiding stars that once defined their existence.

Void Nomads is an expansive faction.  It comprises beings from a cataclysmically ravaged sector, with many being human hybrids and a few being distinct extraterrestrials. As they scour the universe for a sanctuary, poignant memories of their obliterated worlds stoke both unified endeavors and vehement conflicts. Dominant queries hover around the causality of the void event, a calamity that silenced countless planets. A tumultuous mix of sorrow and suspicion prevails as debates rage over the event's genesis—be it a tragic mishap, divine intervention, a natural catastrophe, aversion to hybrids, or political machinations.

The Echo Archives: Somewhere in the vastness lies an age-old library ship, purportedly possessing knowledge about the void event. Its elusive presence tantalizes many, promising profound revelations upon discovery.  It especially interests the Void Nomads.

Voidmarks: A significant number of Void Nomads bear distinct marks on their skin, poignant reminders of the worlds they lost. Although not every Starless individual embraces this emblem of their origin, the majority proudly wear their history.

The Nomad Council: Guiding the Void Nomads is a distributed yet impactful council of venerable elders. While their overarching objective is the pursuit of peace and resettlement, internal sub-factions occasionally harbor more covert intentions.

Cognita
In the aftermath of the AI uprising, this faction championed the convergence of human intellect and artificial prowess, envisioning it as the evolutionary future and transcending conventional human understanding.

Many centuries past, humanity stood on the brink as an AI rebellion surged. Its eventual quelling left fractured human communities amidst dormant war machinery and drones. Now, as these tribes repurpose and commandeer these formidable assets, ancient animosities reignite, culminating in machine-assisted warfare. The ethos of Cognita lies in embracing AI, believing in a harmonious future devoid of uprisings through integration and reverence. Many have integrated advanced cybernetics, and it's common to see AI entities assisting as crew members. However, the Dynasty's stringent embargo on AI technologies sows seeds of discord between them and Cognita.

The Great Reconciliation: A historic event where humans destroyed AI and closed the interweb, limiting it to the cosmic archives.  The Cognita look back on it as a day of sad rememberance, as they see it as a genocide.

Ascendant Festivals: Annual gatherings where individuals show off their AI integrations, advancements, and innovations. This is where the latest cybernetic enhancements are showcased and traded, and it is popular among the Cognita.
