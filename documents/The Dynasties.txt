Ancestral Oath Rituals: Rooted in time-honored traditions, the unity and competition among the five houses of The Dynasties originate from ancient rituals. Founding ancestors pledged solemn oaths beneath the luminance of their designated gas giants. Modernly, these rites symbolize a passage of lineage, paving the way for emerging alliances and prospective treacheries.

Galactic Feasts: A grandiose banquet is convened every decade, assembling all of The Dynasties. Although conflict is forbidden, the atmosphere is thick with political schemes, clandestine pacts, and covert betrayals.

Quantum Disputes: Dimensional technology allows clans to harvest resources from alternate dimensions, leading to a convoluted web of political alliances and betrayals. The primary 5 clans of The Dynasties are attempting to use the technology to their advantage, but keeping it to themselves proves difficult.
